# Documentation

In order to build to documentation, you need to have [sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) installed locally. You can follow the official install instruction: http://sphinx-doc.org/tutorial.html#install-sphinx

Once ``sphinx`` is installed, simply run the following command to build the documentation:

```bash
make html
```
